# Outreach_Project

A computer science & Enviromental research project. The goal of the project is to understand people's behaviour when they have construction work around their area. 

To get the data from the users we use an android app with Amazon aws back-end. The app has prompts the users to answer some questions two time per day depending on the user preferences.
